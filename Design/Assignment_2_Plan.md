Project Pitch:
	Aims: Working Game, Clean Code, Well structured documentation -> good comments, Proof of testing
	Objectives: Working Game, 3D world, Radiants, Collectables, start/end, collision detection, textures, fake gravity(jumping)   

Project Plan:
	12 weeks: atleast 6 milestones Max time: 2 weeks Min Time: variable based on task 
	
	- Milestone 1: working SDL window, and do pitch
	- Milestone 2: textured Cube, and a diamond
	- Milestone 3: camera/controls (look around and move), look into collision detection
	- Milestone 4: implement collision detection and gravity
	- Milestone 5: build level, level design 
	- Milestone 6: Debug and finalize

	Side Goals: Oct trees, Diamond AI (A* algorithm)


Proposed Technologies:
	SDL, C++, GIT_hub, gedit & sublime text, OpenGL 3+, Boost(maybe), Doxygen, CPP_check


Marking Scheme:
	maximum 100%
		30% - Clean Coding
		20% - Github, source Control
		30% - user interaction
		20% - Voxel data structure - testing
